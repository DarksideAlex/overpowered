# Overpowered
Overpowered improves Minecraft’s anvil and enchanting system by removing vanilla limitations and introducing more consistent behavior. Designed for Fabric on Minecraft 1.20.1, it supports both vanilla and modded enchantments as long as they extend the vanilla `Enchantment`-class.

## Overleveling
Enchantment tiers can now exceed their default maximums, and enchantment levels actually add up instead of simply increasing by one. For example, combining a Smite IV book with a Smite III book results in Smite VII. This gives more value to higher-level books and creates room for strategic upgrades.

## Reworked Experience Cost
The experience cost in anvils is recalculated from scratch based on the sum of enchantment levels on the final item. The cost is fully configurable via a multiplier. The “Too Expensive” limit is removed, so players can keep combining enchantments regardless of prior work penalties or vanilla restrictions.

## Overenchanting
Items can now be enchanted with enchantments they normally can’t have. For example, it’s possible to put Flame on boots. However, the mod does not alter how these enchantments function — so while Mending works on elytra, Flame on boots only applies if the boots are modified to behave like bows!

## All For Inclusivity!
Enchantments that are normally mutually exclusive can now be combined freely. For instance, Mending and Infinity can coexist on the same item without conflict.
